# Muet
The Muet paper in 2023 Sesi 3 consists of Reading, Writing, and Listening.

As we all know, Muet is an English course that is compulsory taken by University students.
That's why I uploaded the past year's question that was published by the MPM. 
I would like to give you a picture of what Muet is talking about and how to score it high marks.
Take your own pace to revise your paper and get at least Band 3 to get your university certificate.
